        Studies say that 90% graduates aren’t employable. One side there is a wide gap between the industry expectation and curriculum taught in college. On the other side technology based jobs are increasing day by day. The demand for talented Software Developers is high. The bigger problem is that there aren’t enough talented engineers for the jobs available in the market. CoderHive has taken a small step towards the solution. Its a launchpad for anyone who want get into technology.

  Programming was not my cup of tea in college.<br>
   I was at level 0. I wasn't sure that this would work for me.<br>
    But now I am able to think logically and solve various coding challenges.<br>
     I am grateful for the CoderHive's great environment and mentors, <br>
     especially the unconventional way of teaching and learning.<br>
    One should never miss the experience at CoderHive

        Although I am a computer science student, I always feared coding.<br>
         100 lines of code used to scare me and I used to think: Can I do that?<br> 
         But now all that fears disappeared. I improved my lateral thinking and problem solving capability.<br>
        CoderHive has one of the best curriculum and environment for learning.<br>
         A place where you feel like home and are not judged for mistakes.<br>

    Before joining CoderHive I was reserved and shy most of the time.<br> 
    Now I speak on stage without any fear.
     I got more clarity in thought and speech as wel.<br>
  The biggest thing I like about CoderHive is appreciation. 
    I never saw this in school and college. <br>
    The appreciation encourages people like me to do more.<br> 
    CoderHive is not just about coding, its an overall development with the help of great mentors.
